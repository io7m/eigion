  <Paragraph>
    The punched tape from Operator No. 7's machine slid along the line. It entered a coupling machine and was stripped
    from the tape and repunched upon a tape that was operating at better than a thousand words per minute. Operator 7's
    tape then left the machine to be rolled into a file roll and placed in the vaults below the city. It was of no use
    save as a reference from now on.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    The coupling machine worked furiously. It accepted the tapes from seventy operators as fast as they could write
    them. It selected the messages as they entered the machine, placing a mechanical preference upon whichever message
    happened to be ahead of the others on the moving tapes. The master tape moved continuously at eleven hundred words
    per minute, taking teletype messages from everywhere in the Northern Hemisphere of Venus to any of the other planets
    in the Solar System. It was a busy machine, for even at eleven hundred words per minute, it often got hours behind.

  <Paragraph>
    The synchronous-keyed signal from the coupling machine left the operating room and went to the transmission room. It
    was amplified and hurled out of the city to a small, squat building at the outskirts of Northern Landing.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    Here it was impressed upon a carrier wave and flung at the sky.

    But not alone. Not unguarded. The upper half of the building carried a monstrous parabolic reflector, mounted on
    gimbals. The signal was focused into a beam. The beam was made of two components. The center component was a
    circularly polarized, ultra-high frequency wave of five centimeter waves, modulated with the keying signals of the
    teletype coupling machine. The outer component was a radially polarized wave of one centimeter waves. A radio
    frequency armor.
